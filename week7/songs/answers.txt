In this problem set, I worked with a SQLite database that contains information about songs and their artists. The main goal of this assignment was to practice writing SQL queries to get specific data, like sorting songs by tempo, filtering songs based on different audio features, and calculating averages from the data.
At first, understanding how to order the results correctly and selecting only the required columns was a bit confusing. I made some mistakes, such as ordering by the wrong column, which helped me understand how strict SQL queries need to be to match the expected output exactly. Running the queries directly using sqlite3 helped me debug the issues and check the results before running check50.
Through this assignment, I learned the importance of carefully reading the problem requirements and converting them accurately into SQL statements using clauses like SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY. This problem set improved my confidence in working with databases and showed me how even small mistakes can affect the final results.
